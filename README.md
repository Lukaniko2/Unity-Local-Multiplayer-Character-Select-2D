# Unity-Local-Multiplayer-Character-Select-2D
 This is a project that uses Unity's New Input System to have players join together in game. I have a character select screen set up (2 different versions) so players can configure their characters, then when everyone is ready, they will be moved to the in-game scene. Feel free to use this in your personal projects!
